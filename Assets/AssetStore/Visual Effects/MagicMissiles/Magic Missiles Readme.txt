1. INTRODUCTION
----------------------------------------

To use the effects, simply instantiate them, or drag & drop them into the scene.

The effects will automatically start playing when the scene is running.

----------------------------------------
2. SCALING EFFECTS
----------------------------------------

To scale an effect in the scene, simply use the default Scaling tool (Hotkey 'R'). You can also select the effect and type in the Scale in Transform manually.

----------------------------------------
3. URP UPGRADE
----------------------------------------

To upgrade to URP find the Magic Missiles/Upgrade' folder, double-click the Upgrade package and import to your project.

----------------------------------------
4. CUSTOM SCRIPTS
----------------------------------------

Magic Missiles uses only a few custom scripts for the effects which are optional.

MMLightFade - This script will simply fade out lights after a set amount of time, and works well for explosion effects.
MMLightFlicker - This will make light sources flicker or fade in and out multiple times.
MMRotation - Simple script for rotating effects and lights
